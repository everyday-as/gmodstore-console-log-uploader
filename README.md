# gmodstore-console-log-uploader
The source code for GmodStore's console.log uploader used on-site for automatic console.log uploading to support tickets.

The original code for fetching the console log is derived from code written by [@WilliamVenner](https://github.com/WilliamVenner).

Useful pull requests are welcome :)
